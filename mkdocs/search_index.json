The unit test runs with pytest, a Python test framework, and it can run automatically. Since the backend essentially is providing RESTful API to the client, the way we test the API is by send HTTP request to our testing server to verify responses' status code and content. By doing so, we can easily implement new feature, refactor code, or make any other changes, then test it with existing test cases.\n\n\nUsage\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe test cases is located under the \ntests\n

companies, like Facebook, Airbnb, etc. We would be able test each React component seperately instead of using Selenium for acceptance testing without knowing what exactly go wrong. We are using \nenzyme\n to render the component, \njest\n as unit test framework, and \nsinon\n to mockout the network call. We are able to determine if the component is rendered properly with the fake data we feed in there, and find out if the component will behave properly after certain event is trigger. However, with the limited amount of time, I am only able to complete a part of test cases with this approach.\nThe reason I personally pick this testing approach is:\n\n\n\n\nIt's hard to write comprehensive test cases for React app with Selenium.\n\n\nHelping us break down test cases into each single react component, more throughout than the Selenium.\n\n\nHas been proved to be the best practise for React unit testing by developers from the community, industry, etc.\n\n\nLess pain.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nMore tests will be added upon next release.",

We are using  enzyme  to render the component,  jest  as unit test framework, and  sinon  to mockout the network call. We are able to determine if the component is rendered properly with the fake data we feed in there, and find out if the component will behave properly after certain event is trigger. However, with the limited amount of time, I am only able to complete a part of test cases with this approach.\nThe reason I personally pick this testing approach is:   It's hard to write comprehensive test cases for React app with Selenium.  Helping us break down test cases into each single react component, more throughout than the Selenium.  Has been proved to be the best practise for React unit testing by developers from the community, industry, etc.  Less pain.",
