able test each React component seperately instead of using Selenium for acceptance testing without knowing what exactly go wrong. We are using \nenzyme\n to render the component, \njest\n as unit test framework, and \nsinon\n to mockout the network call. We are able to determine if the component is rendered properly with the fake data we feed in there, and find out if the component will behave properly after certain event is trigger. However, with the limited amount of time, I am only able to complete a part of test cases with this approach.\nThe reason I personally pick this testing approach is:\n\n\n\n\nIt's hard to write comprehensive test cases for React app with Selenium.\n\n\nHelping us break down test cases into each single react component, more throughout than the Selenium.\n\n\nHas been proved to be the best practise for React unit testing by developers from the community, industry, etc.\n\n\nLess pain.\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nAssume you have \nyarn\n install already.\n\n\nyarn run test\n\n\nSample Output\n\n\nPASS  src/components/pages/CommenComponents/AppBarInvitationMenu/index.test.js\nPASS  src/components/common/ArchivedListItem/index.test.js\nPASS  src/components/pages/CommenComponents/RetrieveArchivedListDialog/index.test.js\nPASS  src/components/pages/HomePage/index.test.js\n\nTest Suites: 4 passed, 4 total\nTests:       4 passed, 4 total\nSnapshots:   0 total\nTime:        3.841s\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nMore tests will be added upon next release.",

We are using  enzyme  to render the component,  jest  as unit test framework, and  sinon  to mockout the network call. We are able to determine if the component is rendered properly with the fake data we feed in there, and find out if the component will behave properly after certain event is trigger. However, with the limited amount of time, I am only able to complete a part of test cases with this approach.\nThe reason I personally pick this testing approach is:   It's hard to write comprehensive test cases for React app with Selenium.  Helping us break down test cases into each single react component, more throughout than the Selenium.  Has been proved to be the best practise for React unit testing by developers from the community, industry, etc.  Less pain.",
