# Project Overview

__Collaborative Lists__ is a project management tool for academics and their colleagues to facilitate and coordinate group study sessions. Via a web-based interface, users can save and organize external links to scholarly papers (or journal articles, videos, etc.), share them with the other members of their reading group(s), and participate in a voting system determining which of the shared articles the group will collectively study. Designed to be lightweight and user-friendly, the application can run on any modern browser with a minimum-effort installation.
